<p>NAME gnutls_certificate_free_ca_names - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_certificate_free_ca_names(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t
sc);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc is a
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will delete all the CA name in
the given credentials. Clients may call this to save some
memory since in client side the CA names are not used.
Servers might want to use this function if a large list of
trusted CAs is present and sending the names of it would
just consume bandwidth without providing information to
client.</p>

<p>CA names are used by servers to advertize the CAs they
support to clients.</p>
