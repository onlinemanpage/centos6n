<p>ABRT.CONF(5) ABRT Manual ABRT.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME abrt.conf - Configuration file for abrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION abrt is a daemon that watches for
application crashes. When a crash occurs, it collects the
problem data and takes action according to its
configuration. This document describes abrts configuration
file.</p>

<p>The configuration file consists of items in the format
&quot;Option = Value&quot;. A description of each item
follows:</p>

<p>DumpLocation = directory The directory where should abrt
store coredumps and all files which are needed for
reporting. The default is /var/spool/abrt.</p>

<p>MaxCrashReportsSize = number The maximum disk space
(specified in megabytes) that abrt will use for all the
crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure that the crash
dumps will not fill all available storage space. The default
is 1000.</p>

<p>WatchCrashdumpArchiveDir = directory The daemon will
watch this directory and call abrt-handle-upload on files
which appear there. This is used to auto-unpack crashdump
tarballs uploaded via ftp, scp, etc. The directory must
exist and be writable for abrt. There is no default.</p>

<p>DeleteUploaded = yes/no The daemon will delete an
uploaded crashdump archive after an atempt to unpack it. An
archive will be delete whether unpacking finishes
successfully or not. The default value is no.</p>

<p>DebugLevel = 0-100: Allows ABRT tools to detect problems
in ABRT itself. By increasing the value you can force ABRT
to detect, process and report problems in ABRT. You have to
bare in mind that ABRT might fall into an infinite loop when
handling problems caused by itself. The default is 0 (non
debug mode).</p>
