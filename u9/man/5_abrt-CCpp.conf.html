<p>NAME abrt-CCpp.conf - Configuration file for
ABRT&acute;s core dump crash hook</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The configuration file consists of items in
the format &quot;Option = Value&quot;. Ithe following items
are recognized:</p>

<p>MakeCompatCore = yes / no ... CCpp hook writes its
template to the &quot;/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern&quot;
file and stores the original template in the
&quot;/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern&quot; file. If you
want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
the original template as well, set MakeCompatCore to yes. If
the original template string starts with &quot;|&quot;, the
string &quot;core&quot; is used instead of the template. For
more information about naming core dump files see man 5
core.</p>

<p>MaxCoreFileSize = a number in MiB ... This configuration
option together with MaxCrashReportsSize set the limit on
the size of dumped core file. The lower value of the both
options is used as the effective limit. 0 is evaluated as
unlimited for the both options.</p>

<p>SaveBinaryImage = yes / no ... Do you want a copy of
crashed binary be saved? Useful, for example, when deleted
binary segfaults. Default is no.</p>

<p>IgnoredPaths = /path/to/ignore/, */another/ignored/path
... ABRT will ignore crashes in executables whose absolute
path matches any of the glob patterns listed in the comma
separated list.</p>

<p>AllowedUsers = root, wheel, ... ABRT will process only
crashes of either allowed users AllowedUsers or users who
are members of allowed group AllowedGroups. If no allowed
users nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process
crashes of all users. AllowedUsers is a comma separated
list.</p>

<p>AllowedGroups = root, wheel, ... ABRT will process only
crashes of either allowed users AllowedUsers or users who
are members of allowed group AllowedGroups. If no allowed
users nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process
crashes of all users. AllowedGroups is a comma separated
list.</p>

<p>DebuginfoLocation = /var/cache/abrt-di A colon separated
list of file system paths that specify directories where
ABRT should look for non-system debuginfos. The first path
in the list is used by ABRT to save downloaded debuginfos.
Therefore the first path in the list must be writable. The
rest of the list can be read-only.</p>

<p>VerboseLog = NUM Used to make the hook more verbose</p>
