<p>NAME gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function(gnutls_pkcs11_pin_callback_t
fn, void * userdata);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_pkcs11_pin_callback_t fn The PIN
callback</p>

<p>void * userdata data to be supplied to callback</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will set a callback function
to be used when a PIN is required for PKCS 11
operations.</p>

<p>Callback for PKCS11 PIN entry. The callback provides the
PIN code to unlock the token with label token_label,
specified by the URL</p>

<p>The PIN code, as a NUL-terminated ASCII string, should
be copied into the pin buffer (of maximum size pin_max), and
return 0 to indicate success. Alternatively, the callback
may return a negative gnutls error code to indicate failure
and cancel PIN entry (in which case, the con- tents of the
pin parameter are ignored).</p>

<p>When a PIN is required, the callback will be invoked
repeatedly (and indefinitely) until either the returned PIN
code is correct, the call- back returns failure, or the
token refuses login (e.g. when the token is locked due to
too many incorrect PINs!). For the first such invoca- tion,
the attempt counter will have value zero; it will increase
by one for each subsequent attempt.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS is returned,
otherwise a negative error value.</p>
