<p>NAME gnutls_priority_init - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t *
priority_cache, const char * priorities, const char **
err_pos);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache is a
gnutls_prioritity_t structure.</p>

<p>const char * priorities is a string describing
priorities</p>

<p>const char ** err_pos In case of an error this will have
the position in the string the error occured</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sets priorities for the ciphers, key
exchange methods, macs and com- pression methods.</p>

<p>The priorities option allows you to specify a colon
separated list of the cipher priorities to enable.</p>

<p>COMMON KEYWORDS Some keywords are defined to provide
quick access to common prefer- ences.</p>

<p>&quot;PERFORMANCE&quot; means all the &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites are enabled, limited to 128 bit ciphers and
sorted by terms of speed performance.</p>

<p>&quot;NORMAL&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites. The 256-bit ciphers are included as a fallback
only. The ciphers are sorted by security mar- gin.</p>

<p>&quot;SECURE128&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites with ciphers up to 128 bits, sorted by security
margin.</p>

<p>&quot;SECURE256&quot; means all &quot;secure&quot;
ciphersuites including the 256 bit ciphers, sorted by
security margin.</p>

<p>&quot;EXPORT&quot; means all ciphersuites are enabled,
including the low-security 40 bit ciphers.</p>

<p>&quot;NONE&quot; means nothing is enabled. This disables
even protocols and com- pression methods.</p>

<p>SPECIAL KEYWORDS &quot;!&quot; or &quot;-&quot; appended
with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.</p>

<p>&quot;+&quot; appended with an algorithm will add this
algorithm.</p>

<p>Check the GnuTLS manual section &quot;Priority
strings&quot; for detailed infor- mation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES
&quot;NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128&quot; means normal ciphers
except for ARCFOUR-128.</p>

<p>&quot;SECURE:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE&quot; means that
only secure ciphers are enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, and
libz compression enabled.</p>


<p>&quot;NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;NORMAL:COMPAT&quot; is the most compatible
mode.</p>

<p>RETURNS On syntax error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is
returned, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code.</p>
